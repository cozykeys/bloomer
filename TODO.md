## How to Use USB Type C

(From https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/comments/e56wg4/comment/f9i4er8)

For a USB C port you still need the two 22Î© resistors on the D-/D+ lines just
like [this pic from the guide](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/f41b161c63e5e2c3858d364da42bd73db9501a50/68747470733a2f2f7075752e73682f746c4a6e662f616332633336333036642e706e67).

For the USB-C port to work correctly with C-C cables you also need two 5.1k pull down resistors on the CC pins of the port. [Here's a pic I stole from the internet](https://kicad-info.s3.dualstack.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/original/3X/2/6/2658c42dacf38c694f39a472971a274ff3ef5a91.png). This lets the other USB-C port know that your device needs power and allows the other port to detect cable orientation.
