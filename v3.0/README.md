# CozyKeys Bloomer v3.0

This version was an attempt at improving the keyboard but I ultimately think it
was a step in the wrong direction. The original intent of the keyboard was to
make an ergonomic TKL option and this version actually impacted that goal
negatively. A build log for this is available on Keebtalk until I migrate it to
my own website:
